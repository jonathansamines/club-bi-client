# Club BI client
This a simple client library for the **Club BI** service provided by the BI Bank.

The purpose of this library is to make it easy to handle all queries to that library, in a easy and simple way. As a secondary goal, the current API is too verbose and has a lot of pieces of unrelated data, so it should be easy to get all this data with this client.
